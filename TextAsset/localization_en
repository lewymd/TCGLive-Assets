important things to keep in mind while forming your strategy. Let's learn how to use them to your advantage.","ftue_battle_description_4":"Many Pokémon have Abilities as well as attacks. Let's see how helpful Abilities can be!","ftue_battle_description_5":"Let's learn about how different cards can work together to cause all sorts of effects on your Pokémon.","ftue_battle_description_6":"It's time to apply everything you've learned in a full battle!","ftue_somethingelse":"Let's try something else.","ftue_avatar_prof1":"Welcome to Pokémon Trading Card Game Live!

Tap on that Charizard <sprite name=\"v\"> in the Active Spot.","ftue_battle1_prof1_landscape":"Welcome to your first battle! I'm going to teach you the basics of using your Pokémon's attacks. Click on the Charizard <sprite name=\"v\"> in the Active Spot.","ftue_battle1_prof2":"This card is a Basic Pokémon. These cards can be played directly from your hand to your Bench.","ftue_battle1_prof3":"This is your Pokémon's HP. If it loses it all, it gets Knocked Out!","ftue_battle1_prof4":"Every attack has an Energy requirement. Your Pokémon already has enough Energy attached, so let's go for the attack!","ftue_battle1_prof5":"Your Charizard <sprite name=\"v\"> has a more powerful attack, but it requires 1 more Energy.","ftue_battle1_prof6":"Drag the <sprite name=\"fire\" tint=1> Energy from your hand to Charizard <sprite name=\"v\">.","ftue_battle1_prof6_5":"Most of the time, you get 1 Prize card for Knocking Out a Pokémon—but you get 2 for Knocking Out a Pokémon <sprite name=\"v\"> like Grimmsnarl <sprite name=\"v\">!","ftue_battle1_prof7":"By taking your final Prize cards, you win the match!","ftue_battle2_prof1":"Let's talk about Trainer cards.","ftue_battle2_prof1_5":"Tap on the Evolution Incense in your hand.","ftue_battle2_prof1_5_landscape":"Click on the Evolution Incense in your hand.","ftue_battle2_prof2":"Trainer cards are labeled in the upper-left corner. They have all sorts of helpful uses to assist your strategy.","ftue_battle2_prof3":"Evolution Incense will help you search your deck for an Evolution Pokémon card.","ftue_battle2_prof3_5":"Drag Trainer cards to the board in the center of the screen to play them.","ftue_battle2_prof4":"Evolution is an important tactic in the Pokémon TCG! Go ahead and evolve your Scorbunny into Raboot!","ftue_battle2_prof5":"Oh! I should note you can't evolve the same Pokémon again this turn.","ftue_battle2_prof6":"Not only does Raboot have more HP, but it also has more powerful attacks. Don't forget to charge it up with more Energy.","ftue_battle2_prof7":"First, I want to show you something. Select Raboot.","ftue_battle2_prof8":"Magnum Kick's attack cost requires 2 <sprite name=\"fire\" tint=1> Energy and 1 Energy of any type.","ftue_battle2_prof9":"When you see a <sprite name=\"colorless\" tint=1> Energy symbol, that means any Energy will work. The <sprite name=\"water\" tint=1> Energy in your hand will do just fine!","ftue_battle3_prof1":"In this match, I want to teach you about Special Conditions.","ftue_battle3_prof2":"My Beedrill made your Inteleon Poisoned, which means your Inteleon will continue to take 10 damage during Pokémon Checkup. That's a special step that happens after each of our turns.","ftue_battle3_prof2-5":"Poisoned is just one Special Condition. You'll discover others as you keep playing Pokémon Trading Card Game Live!","ftue_battle3_prof3":"One way to remove Special Conditions from your Pokémon is to get them out of the Active Spot.","ftue_battle3_prof4":"Use Switch to swap in a Pokémon from your Bench.","ftue_battle3_prof5":"Let's take a closer look at my Beedrill. There's something I want to show you.","ftue_battle3_prof6":"Since my Beedrill has Weakness to <sprite name=\"fire\" tint=1>, it will take double damage if you attack it with any <sprite name=\"fire\" tint=1> Pokémon.","ftue_battle3_prof7":"Wow, what a powerful hit! Great Knock Out!","ftue_battle3_prof8":"Even though you're only taking 1 Prize card here, I don't have any Pokémon on my Bench, so you win!","ftue_battle4_prof1":"Not only can Pokémon attack, but they also have useful Abilities that can help your strategy.","ftue_battle4_prof2":"Unlike attacking, using an Ability usually won't end your turn.","ftue_battle4_prof3":"However, most Pokémon Abilities can only be used once per turn.","ftue_battle4_prof4":"Ah! Another useful Trainer card.","ftue_battle4_prof5":"Boss's Orders lets you switch 1 of your opponent's Benched Pokémon into their Active Spot. You get to pick!","ftue_battle4_prof6":"Remember what I taught you about Weakness earlier?","ftue_battle4_prof7":"Seems like there might be something to take note of on each of our Benches…","ftue_battle4_prof8":"Since we know that the Cinderace on your Bench will be strong against my Rillaboom, let's get it into the Active Spot.","ftue_battle4_prof9":"You can retreat your Pokémon as long as you meet the Energy requirements!","ftue_battle5_prof1":"You already have a Pokémon ready in the Active Spot! Go ahead and swing for a big attack!","ftue_battle5_prof2":"Stadium cards are a special type of Trainer card that can affect the entire match! My Training Court lets me get the Energy I need from the discard pile.","ftue_battle5_prof3":"And, just to make sure you don't have enough Energy to attack, I'll play Crushing Hammer, which lets me discard an Energy from your Pokémon if I flip heads.","ftue_battle5_prof3-75":"Lucky me!","ftue_battle5_prof4":"Thanks to my Crushing Hammer, you don't have enough Energy to attack. However even though I played Training Court, you can use it as well!","ftue_battle5_prof4_5":"Hmmm...Maybe I shouldn't have done that...","ftue_battle5_prof5":"Stadium cards have all sorts of useful effects. Use Training Court to recover the <sprite name=\"metal\" tint=1> Energy card I discarded!","ftue_battle5_prof6":"Let's examine your Zacian <sprite name=\"v\">.","ftue_battle5_prof7":"Brave Blade is a powerful attack, but it has a drawback: Zacian <sprite name=\"v\"> can't attack during the next turn, even if you have enough Energy.","ftue_battle5_prof8":"Your Pokémon in play can have both negative and positive effects applied to them. Click on these buttons to see exactly what is happening to your Pokémon.","ftue_battle5_prof9":"Just like Special Conditions, these effects go away if the Pokémon moves to the Bench. And as luck would have it, you drew exactly what you need to get out of this situation!","ftue_battle5_prof9_5":"As as luck would have it, you drew exactly what you needed to get out of this situation!","ftue_battle5_prof10":"Air Balloon is a Pokémon Tool card, which means it can be attached to a Pokémon. And its effect will remain on the Pokémon as long as it's attached.","ftue_battle5_prof11":"A green arrow appeared on Zacian <sprite name=\"v\"> because Air Balloon reduced its Retreat Cost to 0. This lets you switch it out without a penalty. I'd say that's a positive effect!","ftue_battle5_prof12":"Do you see how the red arrow went away once Zacian <sprite name=\"v\"> moved to the Bench? If you can get it back to the Active Spot, you can attack again this turn! The Switch card in your hand will do just that.","ftue_battle5_prof12_5":"Pokémon <sprite name=\"vMax\">are worth 3 Prize cards, so you win!","ftue_battle5_prof13":"Pokémon, Trainers, and even Energy combine together to make all sorts of interesting effects. Finding out how they work together is what makes the Pokémon Trading Card Game so fun!","ftue_battle6_prof1":"Now that you understand the basic actions of the Pokémon Trading Card Game, I think it's time we have a full battle.","ftue_battle6_prof2":"I'll help you through the first few parts of the match, and then we can have a real battle!","ftue_battle6_prof3":"To begin any match, you need to have a Basic Pokémon in your Active Spot. I'd say Zacian <sprite name=\"v\"> is your best option here!","ftue_battle6_prof4":"You should also play some Pokémon to your Bench early as a backup plan. You'll lose the match if your only Pokémon is Knocked Out!","ftue_battle6_prof5":"When you're satisfied with your setup, tap the Done button.","ftue_battle6_prof6":"I have something I'd like to show you. Use that Quick Ball in your hand!","ftue_battle6_prof7":"A couple things. First, you can always use this opportunity to look through the rest of your deck by selecting the All tab.","ftue_battle6_prof8":"Advanced players use this as a tactic to figure out what's in their Prize cards, and they can strategize around that.","ftue_battle6_prof9":"Feel free to browse here until you're ready. Then select Crobat <sprite name=\"v\">.","ftue_battle6_prof10":"Let's take a look at Crobat <sprite name=\"v\">.","ftue_battle6_prof11":"As you can see, Crobat <sprite name=\"v\">'s Dark Asset Ability allows you to draw cards until you have 6 in your hand.","ftue_battle6_prof12":"I suggest playing as many cards as you can before you drag Crobat <sprite name=\"v\"> to your Bench.","ftue_battle6_prof13":"That is all I have left to teach. The rest of the battle is up to you.","ftue_battle6_prof14":"However, I recommend you end your turn by using Oranguru's Primate Wisdom Ability on that <sprite name=\"metal\" tint=1> Energy in your hand, followed by Zacian <sprite name=\"v\">'s Intrepid Sword.","ftue_battle6_prof15":"But you can play this match in whatever style suits you best. Good luck!","ftue_ec_prof1":"Because you finished the tutorials, you've already completed some stuff you need to do.","ftue_ec_prof2":"Let's head over to the Battle Pass to learn about quests!","ftue_ec_prof3":"Welcome to the Battle Pass. Because you completed the tutorial, you've already completed a quest!","ftue_ec_prof4":"Go ahead and tap the completed quest.","ftue_ec_prof5":"Every time you complete a quest, you'll earn either Crystals or Coins and climb a little further on the Battle Pass.","ftue_ec_prof6":"Actions you take in battle also help you climb the tiers, so the more you play, the higher you climb!","ftue_ec_prof7":"You can redeem the reward for the first tier already, so let's collect it and see what you get!","ftue_ec_prof7-125":"Right now you are participating in the Basic Battle Pass","ftue_ec_prof7-25":"but you can unlock even more rewards with a Premium Pass!","ftue_ec_prof7-5":"You can exchange Crystals for a Premium Pass here.","ftue_ec_prof7-75":"The best way to save up Crystals is by completing Daily Quests.","ftue_ec_prof8":"Now let's go use some of those hard-earned Crystals!","ftue_shop_prof1":"You're going to want more cards to give you more options when building your decks. Let's get a booster pack!","ftue_shop_prof2":"To switch between expansions, tap here.","ftue_shop_prof3":"Select the <i>Sword & Shield</i> expansion.","ftue_shop_prof4":"You have just enough Crystals for that booster pack!","ftue_shop_prof5":"Great!
